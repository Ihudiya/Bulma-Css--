                <p>Anything with benefit must also have a drawback. Let's examine that of Bulma</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bulma is still in develpment phase</li>
                    <li>It is a new framework wwhich is not as large of a community.</li>

            <div id="Differences">
                <h1><b>Differences between Bulma and Other css framework</b></h1>
                <p>Both Bulma and Boostrap are free, open source, front-end
                frameworks, mobile first css framework which do simmilar things, 
                but they both differ in complexity, capability, and popularity.</p>
                <h2><b>Bulma Vs Boostrap </b></h2>
                <p>If you are a web developer you should be familiar with Boostrap,
                The most popular css framework. Booostrap has existed for a while 
                before Bulma, So it has  a larger user base and support community. 
                This implies that solutions to advanced problems are more likely to be found
                 with Boostrap than with Bulma.However, Bulma's documntation is detailed and
                 straight forward, and its developers community is growing wit time. </p>
                <p>Bulma is a css only framework unlike Boostrap. It does not come with
                    Javascript(a scripting language for creating dynamic website Content) or Jquery
                preinstalled. Javascript can be intimidating for new developers.If u are not yet ready to start 
                learning a new language, Bulma might be a friendlier step into css framework.
